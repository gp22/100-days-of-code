# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: December 29, 2016

**Today's Progress**: Completed a codewars challenge in Javascript. Worked with string processing and regular expressions.

**Thoughts:** I am really slow at coding right now. Hoping that coding every day and making it a habit will speed up my thinking process and coding ability.

### Day 1: December 30, 2016

**Today's Progress**: More codewars challenges. String and array processing using built in methods.

**Thoughts**: Already feeling more competent and a little faster today!

3. [using .reduce to find shortest word in string](https://github.com/gp22/codeWars_javaScript/commit/468829f7586ea4294b45548f845ae37268219755)

### Day 2: December 31, 2016

**Today's Progress**: Codewars and codingame challenges, worked with Math and Number objects, and loops.

**Thoughts**: I felt totally incompetent today when it took me AN HOUR just to figure out what was going on with the codingame easy challenge! I solved it in Python months ago but for some reason today I was at a loss!

### Day 3: January 1, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Happy new year! Codewars challenge, arrays and loops.

**Thoughts**: It took me an hour and a half to solve this challenge, and reduce it to a single function. That seems like a long time for such a simple task, but I need to remember that I need to be slow before I can be fast! :)

### Day 4: January 2, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Codingame challenges, conditions, arrays and loops.

**Thoughts**: It seemed like I solved this challenge a little quicker than yesterday. I want to get away from these challenges and into 'real' projects ASAP.

### Day 5: January 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Codingame challenges, conditions, arrays and loops.

**Thoughts**: I think the ratings on Codingame challenges are somewhat dubious! I solved 'Mars Lander Episode 1' pretty quick, and then my brain was fully twisted into a pretzel with 'ASCII Art', which is another 'easy' challenge!

### Day 6: January 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Codingame challenge, array and string arithmetic.

**Thoughts**: Woah, some new brain synapses were created during this challenge! I started last night feeling slightly scared that I wouldn't be able to complete this one. After working on it for about an hour yesterday, I came to it today with a better understanding of what was going on. It was still tough, but I completed it successfully!

### Day 7: January 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Codingame challenges, array and string parsing, and dictionary lookups.

**Thoughts**: Not a lot today. Moving forward with my understanding of string and array parsing logic. Started a challenge that involves defining objects for use as a lookup table.
