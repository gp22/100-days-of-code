**Today's Progress**: Completed a codewars challenge in Javascript. Worked with string processing and regular expressions.

**Thoughts:** I am really slow at coding right now. Hoping that coding every day and making it a habit will speed up my thinking process and coding ability.

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.
