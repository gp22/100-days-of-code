# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: December 29, 2016

**Today's Progress**: Completed a codewars challenge in Javascript. Worked with string processing and regular expressions.

**Thoughts:** I am really slow at coding right now. Hoping that coding every day and making it a habit will speed up my thinking process and coding ability.

### Day 2: December 31, 2016

**Today's Progress**: Codewars and codingame challenges, worked with Math and Number objects, and loops.

**Thoughts**: I felt totally incompetent today when it took me AN HOUR just to figure out what was going on with the codingame easy challenge! I solved it in Python months ago but for some reason today I was at a loss!
