# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: December 29, 2016

**Today's Progress**: Completed a codewars challenge in Javascript. Worked with string processing and regular expressions.

**Thoughts:** I am really slow at coding right now. Hoping that coding every day and making it a habit will speed up my thinking process and coding ability.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
