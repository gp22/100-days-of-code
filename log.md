# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: December 29, 2016

**Today's Progress**: Completed a codewars challenge in Javascript. Worked with string processing and regular expressions.

**Thoughts:** I am really slow at coding right now. Hoping that coding every day and making it a habit will speed up my thinking process and coding ability.

**Link to work:** [Printer Errors](https://github.com/gp22/codeWars_javaScript/blob/master/printerErrors/default.js)

### Day 1: December 30, 2016

**Today's Progress**: More codewars challenges. String and array processing using built in methods.

**Thoughts**: Already feeling more competent and a little faster today!

**Link(s) to work**:
1. [Array processing with .filter](https://github.com/gp22/codeWars_javaScript/commit/f72deecd6da5818fdffabcbb0a253c82130cd42a)
2. [4 ways to convert a number to a string](https://github.com/gp22/codeWars_javaScript/commit/c6c73bb07538ab3fc6dfe1584436f9286c8cf8e6)
3. [using .reduce to find shortest word in string](https://github.com/gp22/codeWars_javaScript/commit/468829f7586ea4294b45548f845ae37268219755)

### Day 2: December 31, 2016

**Today's Progress**: Codewars and codingame challenges, worked with Math and Number objects, and loops.

**Thoughts**: I felt totally incompetent today when it took me AN HOUR just to figure out what was going on with the codingame easy challenge! I solved it in Python months ago but for some reason today I was at a loss!

**Link(s) to work**:
1. [Playing with digits](https://github.com/gp22/codeWars_javaScript/blob/master/playingWithDigits/default.js)
2. [The descent](https://github.com/gp22/codInGame_javaScript/blob/master/easy/theDescent/default.js)

### Day 3: January 1, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Happy new year! Codewars challenge, arrays and loops.

**Thoughts**: It took me an hour and a half to solve this challenge, and reduce it to a single function. That seems like a long time for such a simple task, but I need to remember that I need to be slow before I can be fast! :)

**Link(s) to work**:
[Product of consecutive Fibonacci numbers](https://github.com/gp22/codeWars_javaScript/blob/master/productOfConsecutiveFibNumbers/index.js)


### Day 4: January 2, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Codingame challenges, conditions, arrays and loops.

**Thoughts**: It seemed like I solved this challenge a little quicker than yesterday. I want to get away from these challenges and into 'real' projects ASAP.

**Link(s) to work**:
1. [Power of Thor: Episode 1](https://github.com/gp22/codInGame_javaScript/tree/master/easy/powerOfThor-Ep1/index.js)
2. [Temperatures](https://github.com/gp22/codInGame_javaScript/tree/master/easy/temperatures/index.js)

### Day 5: January 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Codingame challenges, conditions, arrays and loops.

**Thoughts**: I think the ratings on Codingame challenges are somewhat dubious! I solved 'Mars Lander Episode 1' pretty quick, and then my brain was fully twisted into a pretzel with 'ASCII Art', which is another 'easy' challenge!
